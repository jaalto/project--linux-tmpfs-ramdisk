# DIRECTORIES TO MOVE TO RAM
#
# - Does not support directories with spaces.
# - Don't add dangling sets, like:
#   /tmp/subdir	 	  - Already covered by /tmp
#   /tmp
# - To set special permissions, specify chmod(1) after a colon(:)
#   /tmp:a=rwx,o+t   	  - With sticky bit set
#
# Tip: for securing data, add only LOW level directores, not
# top level ones.
#
# This is because each directory is a separate "rsync unit". A big top
# level directory would take time to process for determining which
# files to transfer, and in actual transfers time during
# RAM-copy-to-DISK. In a unfortunate case, some process may be writing
# while the FS overlays are OFF and RAM-copy-to-DISK is in progress.
# The written data would not be "lost", not seen, when FS overlays
# are switched ON at the end of RAM-copy-to-DISK cycle.
